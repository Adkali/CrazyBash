"You are working at securitybug as a penetration tester, and at your'e coffee break, joy, your'e friend, wanted to challenge
you with some shell script he made only for you. Joy made a shell script with a username and a password, so you can log
back to your account at your company. He wanted to teach you a lesson after leaving your'e computer with out lock it.
Before even trying, try configuring the shell script and execute it as it should be from the first place.
Oh, and because joy is a good friend, he left you a hint, so use it if you want."
